    <h2 style="color:brown;">What we do:</h2>
    <p>While most people tend to think of hackers as highly skilled people with malicious intentions, the truth is, that
        not every hacker aims to cause harm and use their abilities
        for their own gain. Ethical hackers, also known as White Hat Hackers, are people with great knowledge around
        computer systems that are hired to discover bugs that could be used
        by the bad kind of hackers in order to gain unauthorized access to information systems, and as such, Ethical
        Hackers protect said systems from cyberattacks. Our team's goal is
        to aid the worldwide cybersecurity community with our research while simultaneously providing consulting to
        those in need whenever possible.</p>

    <h2 style="color:brown;">How we (are able to) do it:</h2>
    <p>First and foremost, we believe in our teammates as much as we believe in ourselves. We are eager to learn new
        things and that's the way it should be when it comes to
        keeping everyone online as safe as possible. We take advantage of the tools that are provided to us in order to
        to help us in our line of work and we are grateful to
        all the amazing software, hardware and network engineers that keep working hard to provide not just for us but
        for the whole world in general. Last but not least,
        we would like to thank all the awesome folks that support us in every way possible and for that, we couldn't be
        happy enough.</p>
